                <h2>Have you ever experienced this?</h2>
                <p>Have you ever moved to a new city, started attending a new school, or found yourself in a totally foreign place where you didn't know anyone? Surely we've all experienced this atleast once in our life. One of the first things that come to mind when those type of situations occur, usually runs along the lines of... "Will I make any friends?!?" For some of us, making new friends is a breeze. As for others.... well.. you know. It can be kind of difficult to find the right kind of people you can connect or vibe with. "If only there were an easier way to meet new friends.." Thats where VIIBER comes in!</p>
